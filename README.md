# [Red vs. Blue Project](https://abudhaka.github.io/Capstone_Engagement.pdf)
In this project, I worked on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which I played the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.
As the Red Team, I attacked a vulnerable machine, ultimately gaining root access to that machine.  And, as Blue Team, I used Kibana to review logs taken during the attacks. Here is my [report](https://github.com/abudhaka/Capstone-Engagement/blob/main/Capstone_Engagement.pdf) which presents some suggested mitigation measures for each exploit that I successfully performed.
